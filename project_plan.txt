Project Requirements:-

1. Very simple application, where users can order one or more pizzas from a menu

2. requires no user accounts and no login: user just input their name before using the app.

3. the pizza menu can change, so it should be loading from an API.

4. users can add multiple pizzas to a cart before ordering 

5. ordering requires just the users name, phone number, and address.

6. if possible, GPS location should also be provided to make delivery easier.

7. users can mark their order as priority for an additional 20% off the cart price.

8. orders are made by sending a POST request with the order data (user data + selected pizzas) to the API

9. payments are made on delivery, so no payment processing is necessary in the app.

10. each order will get a unique ID that should be displayed, so the user can later look up their order based on the ID

11. Users should be able to mark their order as "priority" order even after it has been placed.
